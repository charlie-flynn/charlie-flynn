# Hiya! This is Charlie Flynn, and welcome to my profile!

## About me

I'm currenty attending at The Academy of Interactive Entertainment, Lafayette. So far, 
I've done well in learning how to use coding languages like C# and C++, and the Unity game engine. 
I hope to some day have the honor of working on a video game that people will love and speak its praises for years! 
And hopefully that game is also actually good! Could you imagine a *bad* game being praised as if it's good? Hahaha! That
would never happen!

## Portfolio

This section will list the projects I think anyone looking on my profile can be impressed by!

### Runny Egg

The capstone production of my first school year, I worked with 5 artists and 1 other programmer to
make a proper infinite runner game, art assets and all. I was assigned to be the player programmer, but I did 
do a handful of other tasks that had to be done.

#### My Contributions
- Player Controller
- Managers for the player's lives, score, and animations
- Managers for the the title screen and game over screen

### [AI Game](https://github.com/charlie-flynn/GameFramework)

NOT generative AI, I must clarify in this day and age. Game I was assigned to make myself using a pre-made game engine
with minor tweaks. The game had to use A* pathfinding, 6 different steering behaviors, a finite state machine,
and a second decision making strategy for AI.

#### My Contributions
- Most of the steering behaviors
- Tweaked a pre-made Djikstra's algorithm to make A*, using it to traverse a nodemap
- A basic Blackboard
- Made use of all of the above in a finite state machine for the aliens' behavior
- Made two other entities, the EMU Dog and Walterberry
